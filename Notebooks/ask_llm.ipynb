This is because the gauge adjusted MRMS precipitation product lacks the vertical information needed to attribute biases to the vertical distribution of precipitation and its associated Ka-band radar signature. Consequently, the approach we propose here should be considered complementary rather than an alternative to the direct validation.\n",

This is because the averaging kernel defined in Eq. (5) provides information of how the prior uncertainty (which in the CW-EnKS algorithm is the variability of precipitation with clusters) changes due to observations.  Shown in Fig. 4 is the uncertainty reduction in the precipitation estimates, i.e. K\\cdot H\\cdot P_{prior}, due to Ka-band reflectivity observations for cluster 7 in Fig. 2.  As apparent in the figure, the reflectivity observations are most impactful in the ice phase (where the attenuation is low), while the overall reflectivity profile shape provides information on the cluster with profiles most similar to the observed profiles.  However, there observations do not provide information that enables precipitation estimates near surface significantly more accurate than the cluster average. \n",

The vertical distribution of reflectivity for cluster 7 suggests intense convective precipitation and highly attenuated observations.  Dual frequency observations are better determined in reference (due to information in the Ku-band observations).  However, a Ka-band-only algorithm cannot precipitation below the freezing level accurately and the uncertainty reduction due to observations is quite small (about 20%) near surface (range bin 25) relative to the initial uncertainty. \n",

We will then exploit the benefit of the CW-EnKS approach to provide, in addition to providing estimates of the uncertainty associated with the estimates, estimates of the averaging kernels, which can be used to quantify the information content of the observations. Specifically, we will conduct an averaging kernel analysis to investigate how Ka-band observations reduce the a priori precipitation uncertainty (defined as the cluster-wise precipitation covariance).  This analysis, which is more intuitive approaches such as the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method [ref_molnar], is expected to provide insight into the general benefits and limitations of Ka-band precipitation estimates. \n",

    "The TMRW-R1 spacecraft revolves around the Earth at an altitude of around 494.0 km.  The onboard Ka-band radar is a nadir instrument with a fixed antenna orientation and a view angle perpendicular to the earth.  The horizontal resolution at the surface is around 5.0 by 5.0 km and a vertical sampling resolution of about 250 m.  The along-track sampling resolution is about 0.7 km resulting in overlapping field of views.  The spacecraft orbit is sun-synchronous, but at the instantaneous level, the measurements are line measurement (with an additional range dimension that provides information on the vertical distribution of precipitation).  The spacecraft performs about 16 full revolutions per day and the collected data appears to be saved into granule (segments of full orbits) of a few thousand profiles.  We request a few hundred granules of observed Ka-band reflectivity and associated precipitation estimates.  This is a relatively small fraction of the observations collected by the instrument from 6/24/23 to 3/19/24 which the entire record potentially available for this call.  The estimated number of full orbits exceeds 4000 (given about 15 full orbits per days) corresponding to tens of thousands of granules.  We estimate that even a few hundreds granules sampled uniformly from 6/24/23 to 3/19/24 would result in a number of precipitation events on the order of tens.  From the robustness of the results perspective, more granules are preferable, cost permitting.\n",

Are you collaborating with someone who receives funding from Tomorrow.io?  Again, disclose these things if they exist.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Clearer Structure and Comments:**  The code is now well-commented, explaining each step and the purpose of variables.  This makes it much easier to understand.\n",
      "* **Modular Code:**  The code is broken down into functions (e.g., `train_deep_gmm`), making it more readable and reusable.\n",
      "* **`DeepGMM` Class:** The `DeepGMM` class encapsulates the entire model, including the encoder network, GMM parameters (means, covariances, and mixing coefficients), and the forward pass.\n",
      "* **Encoder Network:** The `encoder` attribute is a `nn.Sequential` module representing the neural network. This network transforms the input data into a latent representation. The `hidden_dims` parameter lets you customize the architecture.\n",
      "* **GMM Parameter Initialization:** The GMM parameters (mixing coefficients, means, and log standard deviations) are now initialized as `nn.Parameter` objects.  This is *crucial* because it tells PyTorch to track these parameters and optimize them during training.  Random initialization is used to break symmetry. The `log_sigma` is used instead of `sigma` for numerical stability during optimization, ensuring sigma stays positive.\n",
      "* **`forward` Method:**  The `forward` method performs the entire forward pass: encoding the input data to the latent space using the neural network and then calculating the log probabilities of the data belonging to each GMM component.\n",
      "* **`log_probability` Method:** This method calculates the log probabilities of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component. It uses the formula for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.  It is also using the logsumexp trick.  This calculates `log(sum(exp(x)))` in a numerically stable way, which is essential for avoiding overflow when dealing with exponentials of negative numbers.\n",
      "* **`loss` Method:** The `loss` method calculates the negative log-likelihood, which is the standard loss function for GMMs.  The goal of training is to minimize this loss.\n",
      "* **`train_deep_gmm` Function:** This function encapsulates the training loop.  It iterates through the data in batches, calculates the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the model's parameters.\n",
      "* **Data Loading with `DataLoader`:** Uses `DataLoader` for efficient batching of data during training.  This is much better than iterating over the entire dataset in each epoch.\n",
      "* **Data Standardization:** Emphasizes the importance of standardizing the input data *before* training.  GMMs (and neural networks) often perform much better when the data is centered and scaled.\n",
      "* **Validation Set:** Includes splitting the data into training and validation sets, allowing you to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.\n",
      "* **Evaluation Mode:** The `model.eval()` and `with torch.no_grad()` context is correctly used during the evaluation phase. This is important because it disables gradient calculations and certain layers (like dropout) that are only used during training.\n",
      "* **Inference Example:** Shows how to use the trained model to assign new data points to clusters. It correctly preprocesses the new data (scaling it using the same `scaler` used for training data).\n",
      "* **Clearer Example Dataset:**  Uses `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs` to create a synthetic dataset, which is a common and easy way to generate data for clustering tasks.\n",
      "* **Numerical Stability:** Using `log_sigma` and `logsumexp` for increased stability during training and inference.\n",
      "* **Complete, Runnable Example:** The code provides a complete, runnable example, including data generation, model definition, training, evaluation, and inference.  This allows you to copy and paste the code and run it directly.\n",

      "How to run the code:\n",

      "   pip install torch scikit-learn numpy\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "2. **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire code into a Python file (e.g., `deep_gmm.py`).\n",

Our initial intention was to use the model encodings rather than the physical state variables, but encoded state has 2500 channels (some of which exhibit incoherent patterns).  While I am sure these channels are important in the model's forecasting capabilities, they are not necessarily conducive to the most efficient approach to diagnosing the model's precipitation.  \n",

      "**Understanding the Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GMM Fitting:** Fitting a GMM to one distribution (let's call it `P`) is a good way to represent it as a mixture of Gaussians. This provides a parametric approximation of `P`. This is your `P(x)` in the KL divergence calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evaluating the Second Distribution:**  You're using the GMM fitted to `P` to evaluate how well the second distribution (let's call it `Q`) \"fits\" the model learned from `P`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monte Carlo KL Divergence:** Using Monte Carlo integration for KL divergence is a standard method when an analytical solution isn't available (which is almost always the case with complex distributions).  The idea is to sample from one distribution and then estimate the KL divergence using the sampled data.\n",

      "\n",
      "This can be read as: the information lost when Q is used to approximate P.  Note that KL divergence is *not* symmetric; KL(P || Q) is generally not equal to KL(Q || P).\n",

You'd use KDE on the samples from Q to evaluate Q(x_i).\n",

It's an alternative to GMMs with its own strengths and weaknesses. Let's break down your idea, discuss its merits, and compare it to GMMs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding Your Proposed Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clustering:** You plan to use a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) on the combined dataset from both distributions. The goal is to group data points that are \"similar\" to each other, regardless of which original distribution they came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cluster-Specific KL Divergence:** For each cluster identified, you'll separate the points belonging to that cluster based on their original distribution. You'll then compute the KL divergence between these two sets of points *within that specific cluster*.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Overall Similarity:**  You'll likely need to aggregate the cluster-specific KL divergences to get an overall measure of similarity between the two distributions. This could involve averaging them, weighting them by cluster size, or using some other combination strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This Approach Can Be Useful**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Less Sensitive to Sample Size Imbalance:** By clustering first, you're effectively normalizing the comparison *within* each cluster. Even if one original distribution is much larger, the KL divergence calculation within a cluster is comparing proportions or relative frequencies within that localized region of the data space.  This mitigates the impact of overall sample size disparities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Non-Parametric:**  Clustering algorithms, especially those like DBSCAN, are often non-parametric.  You don't need to assume that your data follows a specific distribution (like a Gaussian), which is a limitation of GMMs. This is helpful if your data is complex and multimodal.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus on Local Similarity:** The approach emphasizes local differences between the distributions.  If the distributions are very different overall, but have regions where they are similar, your cluster-based approach can highlight those similarities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Interpretability (potentially):** Clustering can give you insights into *where* the two distributions differ.  You can examine the clusters with the highest KL divergence to understand which regions of the data space are most dissimilar.\n",

      "* **Cluster Validation:** Before calculating KL divergences, validate the quality of your clusters.  Metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or Calinski-Harabasz index can help you assess how well the data is clustered. Poorly formed clusters will lead to meaningless KL divergences.\n",

Specifically, although at the fundamental level, the cluster-weighted EnKS operates as an explicitly constructed feed-forward neural network, with each cluster corresponding to a given activation in an associated neural network, its explicit estimation of the Kalman Gain,  **K**<sub>k</sub>, and the observation operator, **H**<sub>k</sub>, enables a direct and interpretable estimation of uncertainties in the prediction. This provides valuable insight into the factors influencing the estimate.  In contrast, the uncertainty estimates in the TMRW-R1 are based on a quantile regression approach [] that is less interpretable, especially in multivariate estimation problems.\n",

      "**The true power of this comparison lies in its diagnostic capabilities.  Agreement between the TMRW-R1 estimates and the cluster-weighted EnKS estimates, especially when coupled with consistent uncertainty quantification, bolsters confidence in both algorithms. However, *disagreement acts as a critical diagnostic tool*.  It highlights specific regimes or input conditions where the ML-based approach might be struggling, potentially due to limitations in its training data or an inability to effectively handle specific attenuation scenarios.  By examining these discrepancies and analyzing the EnKS's interpretable uncertainty estimates in these cases, we can pinpoint the underlying causes of the differences and identify areas where the TMRW-R1 algorithm could be improved.  This comparative approach transforms the evaluation process from a simple validation exercise into a powerful mechanism for advancing our understanding of both algorithms and the inherent challenges of Ka-band precipitation estimation.\"**\n",

    "I am planing on evaluating estimates from an algorithm using estimates from another algorithm that can be proven to be unbiased, is interpretable and has good uncertainty estimates. The first algorithm also provides uncertainty estimates but they more difficult to interpret. And even if they agree, the comparison is beneficial. If they don't agree more work is needed to understand the differences, which are probably related to the information content in the input. But I want to empasize the need to comparison.  Here is what I have so far. Could you add something to emphasize the benefit of the comparison based evaluation?\n",

    "As previously described the estimation precipitation from Ka-band radar observations using physics-based models is prone to large uncertainties and biases in some regimes due to reduced information content in the observations caused by large attenuation. ML-based estimation algorithms trained on reliable input are more accurate and robust as they rely on statistical relations to compensate for the potential lack on information in the bottom portion of the observed profiles.  While the TMRW-R1 official precipitation estimates are derived using an ML approach, their evaluation against independent estimates provided by the clustered-weighted EnKS approach described in the previous section is beneficial from the interpretability of results perspective.
